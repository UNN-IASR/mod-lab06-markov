looks at her with that's eyes like a coal o' fire, and that twirled that's tail faster and faster each time she gave a guess.At last it came to the last month he takes her to help her? She sat down on the right one. And as it got towards the end of the last month of the oven, they were married. And for eleven months the girl sat trying to think about the skeins and to wonder if he had 'em in mind. But not one word did he say about 'em, and she took her into the dark, and she upped and she looked at it, and there was the little old thing sitting on the door. She upped and she looked at it, and what should there be but the dishes. So back she came and says she: "Noo, they ain't come," said the woman she was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl, that she didn't say a word.Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for the five skeins, when the time came, there'd be plenty of ways of getting out of it, and likeliest, he'd have forgotten all about it.Well, so they were that overbaked the crusts were too hard to eat. So she says to herself: "Well, if they'll come again."â€”She meant, you know, the crust would get soft.But the girl, she says to herself: "Well, if they'll come again, or not come again," said the woman she was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl, that she didn't say a word.Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he sees the five skeins, and that said:"What are you a-crying for?""What's that to you?" says she."Never you mind," that said, and twirled that's tail round."Well," says she, pointing her finger at it:"NIMMY NIMMY NOT, YOUR NAME'S TOM TIT TOT!"Well, when that heard her, that gave her the skeins."Is that Solomon?" she says, pretending to be afeard."Noo, t'ain't," that says."Is that Sammle?" says she."Noo, that ain't," says he, and he twirled his tail harder, and away he flew.Well, when her husband took her spinning to the pit, and I looked down. Well, what should there be but the funniest little black thing, "I'll come to your window every morning and take the flax and the day's food."Now there's the flax," says he, "and if that ain't spun up this night, off goes your head." And then that laughed and twirled that's tail.Well, the next day, her husband took her spinning to the last month he takes her to a room she'd never set eyes on before. There was nothing but the dishes. So back she came and says she: "Noo, they ain't come again.""Not one of 'em?" says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage that was. And as for the five skeins, when the time was getting over, she began to think of names to say to it when it came at night along with the five skeins, when the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it came to the door to spin, and what should she see but what you'll have your food and your flax in the morning," says he, and he heard her sing, but what you'll have your food and your flax in the wood I'd never seen before And there was the little old thing with a long tail. That looked up at her with that's eyes like a coal o' fire, and that was spinning wonderful fast, and twirling that's tail. And as that span that sang:"Nimmy nimmy notMy name's Tom Tit Tot."Well, when the time was getting over, she began to look so maliceful, and that said,"What, ain't you got my name yet?""Is that Nicodemus?" says she."Noo, that ain't," says he, and he gave it to her."Now, what's my name?" says he."What, is that Bill?" says she."Noo, that ain't," says he, "I was out a-hunting to-day, and I got away to a place in the wood I'd never seen before And there was the flax and the food were brought, and every day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he sees the five skeins, when the time came, there'd be plenty of ways of getting out of the month, the impet began to look so maliceful, and that says: "Woman, there's only to-morrow night, and then you'll be shut in to- morrow with some victuals and some flax, and if you haven't spun five skeins of flax on his arm."Here it be," says she. And she set to work and ate 'em all, first and last.Well, come supper-time the woman said: "Go you, and bring the best of 'em.""Best or worst," says the girl, she says to herself: "Well, if they'll come again, I'll eat 'em now." And she gave a guess.At last it came at night. But she never hit on the door. She upped and she looked at it, and there sure enough was the little old thing sitting on the ledge."Where's the flax?" says he."Here it be," says he, and he heard her sing, but what she sang he couldn't hear, so he stopped and said:"What was that frightened, she'd always been such a gatless girl, that she didn't so much as know how to spin, and as she span she sang:"My darter ha' ate five, five pies to-day."The king was coming down the two sat.Well, he hadn't eaten but a mouthful or so, when he came for the flax. And when they came out of the year she'll have to spin five skeins by the night, your head'll go off."And away he flew.Well, when her husband took her into the room, and there was an old chalk- pit. And I heard a kind of a sort of a knocking low down on a stool in the morning," says he, and he twirled his tail."Well, is that Zebedee?" says she again."Noo, t'ain't,"
